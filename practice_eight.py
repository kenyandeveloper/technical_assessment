Problem 8: a function called move_zeroes
function -> takes a list of integers and moves all the zeroes to the end
of the list while maintaining the relative order of the non zero elements 
"""
#input A list of integers num
#The same list with all zeroes moved to the end
#took me 20 minutes to come up with this half baked solution, don't even know where to start lmaooðŸ˜‚
"""
first -> identify non zero elements 
iterate through the list and find all  the non zero elements. These elements 
should stay in their relative order

2.Move non-zero elements to the front
use a pointer (write index ) to keep track of where to write the next non-zero 
element as you iterate through the list

3.Fill the remaining Positions with Zeroes
once all non-zero elements are writen to the front of the list, fill the rest with zeroes
